    <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
    <p><h2>Autonomous Human Detection with AI Interfaced Chatbot</h2> <br>
    
		This Project Was Developed To Help Old Age People Who Are Home Alone. This Bot Was Assisted By Ai (which Is A Self-designed Ai Called Ai Josh). The Bot Can Be Controlled Or Used To Follow The Person By Using Their Movements, Heat From That Person. Ai Will Fetch Details, Songs, Or Jokes That Person Requires. It Also Contains A Camera. If Any Fishy Things Happen, It Will Report To The Closest Person As Well As The Police. <br><br>
    
   <h2>Women Safety Surveillance Bot</h2> <br>
    
   We Are Introducing A Women Safety Bot That Is Used Where Police Can't Go For Patrol. This Women Safety Bot Has A Lot Of Complex Algorithms. It Is Made Up Of Several Sensors (ir, Ultrasonic, Etc.) And Motors Which Are Interfaced With A Microcontroller(arduino). This Function, While Detecting Heat Sensation From The Human Body, Tends To Follow Them If Any Mischievous Activity Happens Like Scanning The Person's Face Or Vehicle Number, Which Has Already Contained Any Complaint Against It, And Sends A Report To The Control Room With Video And Exact Location. <br><br>
    
    <h2>Amplifying Hearing Aid Software using Deep Learning and Matlab</h2><br>
    
	To Enhance The Actual Sound In Any Audio Signal By Filtering The Noise Using The Mfcc Technique And Deep Learning Iterative Network Concept With The Help Of Matlab Software.<br><br>
